	<h3> Overview </h3>
	<p>
	<br>
	The objective of the smart parking meter is to notify users of available street parking near their desired location to help eliminate time spent searching for street parking in busy city streets. The team designed and prototyped a new parking meter with an associated app to accomplish this goal. The meter itself performs all the normal functions of a traditional parking meter like notifying parking attendants of unpaid parking and accepting payment for parking. The unique features of the meter are (1) the use of sensors to identify whether a car is parked in the spot or not in real time and notify app users with this information and (2) navigation to open parking spots near desired destination and rerouting as spots open and close.

	<h3> Why is this important? </h3>
	<p>
	<br>
	The motivation behind designing the smart parking meter system is to limit time spent searching for parking and provide users a stress-free city parking experience. By the end of the project, the team aspires to develop a complete parking system that encompasses finding the closest spot to a given destination and then navigating to it. Once at the spot, the user will be able to easily pay and experience their destination without the associated parking stress. The current intended audience for the app is smart-phone users that need to navigate around a large city, but the prototype could expand to work within smaller districts. The smart parking meter will increase parking enforcement revenue, as spot detection can increase city revenue by an average of 25-50% by reporting parking violations. Given the product will be comparable in price to alternatives, city governments will be incentivised to choose this product because of its superior features and design.
